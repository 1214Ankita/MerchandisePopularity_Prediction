# MerchandisePopularity_Prediction

##### Overview 
This machine learning project predicts merchandise popularity by processing and 
analyzing store-related data. The workflow includes data loading, duplicate 
removal, and handling missing values, followed by exploratory data analysis 
(EDA). After splitting the data into training and testing sets, four classification 
models— Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting and 
Logistic Regression —are trained and evaluated based on accuracy and 
classification reports. The objective is to determine the best model for predicting 
merchandise popularity based on store attributes. 
This project focuses on predicting merchandise popularity by analyzing store
related data. The workflow involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis 
(EDA), model training, and evaluation.
